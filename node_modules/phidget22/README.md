Official Phidget22 JavaScript library.

This library includes both Node.js and browser support.

Phidgets are accessed over the network via the [Phidget Network Server](https://www.phidgets.com/docs/Phidget_Network_Server).

Newer Phidgets can also be opened directly over USB, allowing for no-install access within the Browser or Node.js.

A smaller network only library is also available: [phidget22-net](https://www.npmjs.com/package/phidget22-net)

Start by reading the [Phidgets JavaScript Language Page](https://www.phidgets.com/docs/Language_-_JavaScript).

* [Node.js Code Samples](https://www.phidgets.com/?view=code_samples&lang=JavaScript&os=Nodejs)
* [Browser Code Samples](https://www.phidgets.com/?view=code_samples&lang=JavaScript&os=Browser)

## Prerequisites

USB Access in Node.js requires installation of the optional [usb](https://www.npmjs.com/package/usb) dependency.

USB Access in the Browser requires a browser that supports [WebUSB](https://caniuse.com/webusb)

## Node.js

```bash
npm install phidget22
```
ES6 module import:
```javascript
import * as phidget22 from 'phidget22';
```
CommonJS import:
```javascript
const phidget22 = require('phidget22');
```

## Browser

Download the latest release [here](https://www.phidgets.com/downloads/phidget22/libraries/any/Phidget22JavaScript.zip).

The release contains full, net, and usb versions of the library, in both UMD and ES module format.

UMD import:
```html
<script src="phidget22.min.js"></script>
```
ES6 module import:
```html	
<script type="module">
	import * as phidget22 from './phidget22.esm.js';
</script>
```

You can also load the library directly from [UNPKG](https://unpkg.com/):

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/phidget22@^3.10/browser/phidget22.min.js"></script>
```

App bundlers such as Webpack are supported with browser-specific files in the npm.
